Integrated Lab Supportive System

Atmel Studio | Arduino mega | Sensors and Electronic Components

An Integrated Lab Supportive system can be introduced as a system bringing various lab instruments into a one system creating an all-in-one mini lab. Having different measuring instruments in a distance that can be reached by hand is the basic functionality of this system. It also supports different ways of taking measurements and observations in automated ways. 
Basically, providing one system for each user inside the chemistry laboratory is corresponding to a computer laboratory where each user having one computer. For general chemistry studies in schools and colleges having this type of system makes experimenting easier and user-friendly because system is made for user to be focused more on observation.
